# Object Oriented Javascript - Dinosaur Project
This project is an infographic that is derived from data that is provided, as well as user input data. Object-oriented javascript is great for working with complex data, but itâ€™s not of much use without an interface to interact with. I pulled in information from a form and used it to complete an array of objects that will then be appended back to the DOM.

## Install and Run

1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. Using a python server (which is native on a mac), you will run a local server to view the page.  If you have a windows machine and don't have python, please visit this website to continue: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server
3. In your terminal make sure to navigate to the directory that you downloaded the application in. 
4. Type `http-server` in to your terminal to start the page.  Your browser should load automatically, if not you can get to the app using: http://localhost:8080
